# LayeredPipe
LayeredPipe is a layered inter-process communication (IPC) simulation project designed to mimic network communication between a Producer and Consumer using UNIX pipes. It explores how data can be sent between two processes using different layers of communication, each responsible for specific tasks, similar to how network protocols work.
